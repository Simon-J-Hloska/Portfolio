## Orders Management Application 
### Overview
**Orders Management Application** is a console-based application for managing orders, customers, and products using Python 3 and MySQL.
The application provides an easy way to manage data, import CSV/JSON files, and generate reports.

## LensCull — Image Similarity Checker
### Overview
**LensCull** is a Python-based application for computing visual similarity between images. It is designed to identify near-duplicates and assess image quality across datasets using perceptual techniques and statistical comparisons. The project emphasizes clean architecture, testability, and performance.

## Face Recognition System (Raspberry Pi)
### Overview

**Face Recognition System** is a real-time face recognition application built in Python for Raspberry Pi devices. The project enables capturing image datasets, training facial embeddings, and recognizing individuals in a live camera stream. It is optimized for edge deployment using lightweight computer vision pipelines and hardware-aware performance tuning.

The system uses OpenCV for video processing, the face_recognition library (dlib-based embeddings) for facial encoding, and PiCamera2 for native Raspberry Pi camera integration. The workflow includes dataset collection, model training via serialized embeddings, and real-time inference with FPS monitoring.
