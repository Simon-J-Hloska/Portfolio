## Face Recognition System (Raspberry Pi)
### Overview

**Face Recognition System** is a real-time face recognition application built in Python for Raspberry Pi devices. The project enables capturing image datasets, training facial embeddings, and recognizing individuals in a live camera stream. It is optimized for edge deployment using lightweight computer vision pipelines and hardware-aware performance tuning.
The system uses OpenCV for video processing, the face_recognition library (dlib-based embeddings) for facial encoding, and PiCamera2 for native Raspberry Pi camera integration. The workflow includes dataset collection, model training via serialized embeddings, and real-time inference with FPS monitoring.

## CalendarForChessFans
### Overview

**CalendarForChessFans** is a console-based C# calendar and planner tailored for chess enthusiasts. The application allows users to manage personal events while providing live chess content, thematic features, and flexible filtering. Key functionality includes monthly calendar views, event creation and search, notifications, and JSON-based local storage. Optional enhancements include API integration for recent chess games and mini chess widgets.
The project leverages **C# .NET 9** with **Spectre.Console** for a styled terminal interface, **System.Text.Json** for data storage, and **HttpClient** for fetching live content from chess APIs such as Lichess and Chess.com.
